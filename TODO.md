# TODO URGENT

- Type safety. Whole thing is rather JS than TS. Make it all typed.

- Allow not specifying names! Random does not work yet

- Specify zod dependency version better (the least required)

- More flexible than just input? Maybe inherit from other class? / extend

- Submit button can be added

- Other elements can be added as well

- Add optional schemaArray param, for example for a password you want multiple with each having a specific error msg

- Better types, better project structure

- Even less boilerplate

- Maybe shorter names?

- Allow schema on form so you can also have schema for multiple inputs

- "ALL children with input must have "name" property set to function properly" --> Add warning

# TODO OTHER

- Check rerendering logic. Must be perfect

- Make sure super performant and compare to other libraries
