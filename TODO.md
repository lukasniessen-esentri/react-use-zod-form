# TODO URGENT

- Type safety. Whole thing is rather JS than TS. Make it all typed.

- Allow not specifying names! Random does not work yet

- Specify zod dependency version better (the least required)

- More flexible than just input? Maybe inherit from other class? / extend

- Submit button can be added

- Other elements can be added as well

- Add optional schemaArray param, for example for a password you want multiple with each having a specific error msg

# TODO OTHER

- Check rerendering logic. Must be perfect
