# TODO URGENT

- Error handling, good response typed object

- Name given if not specified is random for now. Probably not good.

- Specify zod dependency version better (the least required)

- (?) Move handle error to input level, not form level. More handy probably

- More flexible than just input? Maybe inherit from other class? / extend

- Submit button can be added

- Other elements can be added as well

# TODO OTHER

- Check rerendering logic. Must be perfect
