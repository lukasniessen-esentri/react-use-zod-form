# TODO URGENT

- Rename "Zs" to "ZodSchema" or sth
- Or allow both

- Add patching for things like "Required", "IsValid" (for function that will validate), other things

- Maybe rename the library then?

- Note: our monkey patched attribute all start with Capital letters. That is to avoid confusion and collusion with other libraries. 
  It marks them and avoids problems.

- JS compatitble and JS docs

- Double valid import src ?? fix

- If TS configs are needed, add info about that in docs!!

- Allow non-zod validation

- Password form example add, with (list-passed-not-passed-tests)

- Docs gut machen

- Allow schema on form so you can also have schema for multiple inputs

- Make sure it can be used for UI libraries as well, put example in docs !!!

- Submit button can be added

- Other elements can be added as well

- Add optional schemaArray param, for example for a password you want multiple with each having a specific error msg

- Even less boilerplate

- "ALL children with input should have "name" property set to function properly" --> Add warning

# TODO OTHER

- Check rerendering logic. Must be perfect

- Make sure super performant and compare to other libraries

- Better types, better project structure
