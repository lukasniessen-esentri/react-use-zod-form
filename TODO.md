# TODO

- Check rerendering logic. Must be perfect

- Error handling

- Name given if not specified is random for now. Probably not good.

- Specify zod dependency version better (the least required)

- (?) Move handle error to input level, not form level. More handy probably

- Breaks when you add more than one ZodInput. Fix

- More flexible than just input? Maybe inherit from other class? / extend
